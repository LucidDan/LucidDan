Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my GitHub home. I'm Dan Sloan, a consulting software developer.

I run a consultancy called [Lucid Horizons](https://lucidhorizons.com.au/). We are based in Melbourne, Australia, on the lands of the [Bunurong People](https://www.bunuronglc.org/), and I wish to acknowledge them as Traditional Owners.

# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

## OSS
- [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/) - using this for several projects, and hopefully providing some contributions to the cool new kid on the block of GraphQL and Python

## Personal
I'm rebuilding my presence online after a bit of a mental health hiatus. I'm trying to do this while keeping social media to a minimum.
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) are probably going to feature heavily on the blogging side, with hosting on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

## Client

Most of my client work is confidential, but one of my favourites is [WiFi Tribe](https://wifitribe.co/), a company helping professionals that want to travel and work remotely in a community of like-minded people.

# ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- [React Location](https://react-location.tanstack.com/) - it's still in development, but I've been trying it out and enjoying the experience so far.
- [Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - I love Django, but I really wanted to start looking at more modern approaches like FastAPI. Channels is proving to be a great intermediary, providing much of the advantages of async without losing the benefits of a mature framework like Django.
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - huge fan of FastAPI's approach, especially Dependency Injection. I've been a bit disappointed in most of the ORM options so far...but...
- [Tortoise ORM](https://tortoise-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - I've had a number of recommendations from people I trust, so I'm starting to learn and play with Tortoise. Django's ORM is still my goto, but Tortoise seems really interesting!

# ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- For commercial tings, contact the business at [Lucid Horizons](https://lucidhorizons.com.au/)
- For personal tings, Twitter is best! [@Lucid_Dan](https://twitter.com/Lucid_Dan/); DMs remain open (so far)
- I'm largely uncontactable in any other private way, unless you already know me.
