Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my GitHub home. I'm Dan Sloan, a consulting software developer. I mostly do consulting with other software companies and clients, mostly working on web applications in Python and Django.

I run a consultancy called [Lucid Horizons](https://lucidhorizons.com.au/). We are based in Melbourne, Australia, on the lands of the [Bunurong People](https://www.bunuronglc.org/), and I wish to acknowledge them as Traditional Owners.

# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

## OSS
- Not actively working on anything OSS related at the moment, I've had too much else on my mind lately...hoping to get involved more actively and permanently on one of the projects that interests me soon.

Honorable mention:
- [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/) - not doing any GraphQL work at the moment, but if you are this is one of the best Python based GraphQL projects, in my opinion.

## Personal
I'm (still) rebuilding my presence online after a bit of a mental health hiatus. It's been a tough slog but the unexpected decline of twitter has actually helped.
- You can find me on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@LucidDan/). I've pretty much decided that's the ONLY social media I plan to be present in any serious way on.

## Client

Most of my client work is confidential, but one of my favourites is [WiFi Tribe](https://wifitribe.co/), a company helping professionals that want to travel and work remotely in a community of like-minded people.

# ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) - a great little library that enables much of the "responsive design" capabilities that makes React so interesting, without actually needing any React or client-side code. I've moved most of my existing client work towards either partial or complete adoption of this.
- [Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - I love Django, but even with more and more async support there are some things Django just can't do (SSE being high on that list). I've been using Channels as way to accomplish that.
- [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) - Started doing some packaging work lately, and while the core packaging tools are great, Hatch seems like it fills a few gaps and lets me avoid writing any extra utility tools for version management, publishing, etc. Pretty nice.
- [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) - I've been doing bits and pieces on Wagtail for years, but finally putting a concerted effort into learning it fully. It's a great CMS and I think is actually at a point where I might recommend it as a CMS for some clients.

# ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- For commercial tings, contact the business at [Lucid Horizons](https://lucidhorizons.com.au/)
- For personal tings, ~~Twitter is best! [@Lucid_Dan](https://twitter.com/Lucid_Dan/); DMs remain open (so far)~~ get in touch on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@LucidDan/)
- I'm largely uncontactable in any other private way, unless you already know me and have my number.
